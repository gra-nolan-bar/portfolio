        <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
        Getting started, there is a lot that feels natural, but other material
        that feels very foreign. Going to take some time getting the hang of it!
        I have always been extremely interested in web development and
        information technology. My interests were sparked early on in my career,
        and I am excited to complete this certification and get some hands on
        experience in creating HTML code and utilizing my problem solving skills
        in front-end web development.

        <h3>My Property Management Journey</h3>
        I am currently working in property management in the downtown Seattle
        area. I started off this career in Portland, OR with managing two small
        vintage properties that were built in the 1920's. I now work at a brand
        new high-rise building in the heart of downtown Seattle. I have learned
        much in this role and truly enjoy the challenge.

        <h3>My Hotel Management Journey</h3>
        I started out in hotel management in 2013 at a beach-front resort in
        Laguna Beach. I worked as a front desk agent for two years, and a bell
        captain for another two years. I moved to Portland, OR in 2017 and
        worked at a few hotels in the downtown Portland area, including the
        opening of a new hotel in late 2018. My favorite part about working in
        hotels has always been on the software side of the job. I love poking
        around in the configuration settings of our PMS and other systems. It
        really sparked my interest in the tech industry and I hope to someday
        soon make the career change. I am looking forward to this first major
        step in the right direction by taking the UW Front-End Web Developer
        Certification in 2024!
